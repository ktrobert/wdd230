            <p>Alignment is the arrangement of elements on a page. In web design, the principle of alignment is very important to keep a web page looking clean and orderly. Aligning elements on a page makes it easy for the audience to navigate the website.
                In this website above, there is a great use of alignment. All the pictures are the same shapes and are aligned in unison which makes the sight well balanced and pleasing to the eyes. Even though the images are different sizes, the designer
                arranged it so that it can be uniformly attractive.

            </div>
            <p>Contrast is the difference in lighting between anything in the foreground and its background in the website. By using contrasting colors, images, and sizes, a website’s visibility is dramatic enough to distinguish the great content you've
                developed for your website so it can be understood by everyone. The website above has the two distinct colors that are greatly contrasted with the bright pink background and complete white logo in the foreground makes the website so dynamic.
                The small white basketball player logo really sticks to your brain. This idea is very simple but stays embedded in your brain.

            <p>Whitespace or negative space is the space between elements in a composition. It provides visual breathing room for the eye. Whitespace creates harmony, balance, and helps the branding of design. Whitespace can be used to lead a reader from
                one element to another. The website above has a great use of whitespace. The setting of the font and images are distinctly separated to give the phone image as the focal point. This makes the website look simple and uncluttered. Straightway,
                the reader’s eyes can easily see that the main idea of the webpage is the phone.
