        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            Our goal is to help further the interests of small businesses in American Fork City. We want the city to be informed about the local businesses in the area and what they have to offer. We also host events, lobbying local representatives to charitable
            works, for the betterment of the community. We hope to help the members with cost saving programs and services. Members will have a chance to voice public policies in the Chamber Policy Councils. We want to develop businesses for those who
            are interested in marketing and promotional opportunities, providing access to valuable resources, discounts, and relationships.
