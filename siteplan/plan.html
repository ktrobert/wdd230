        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
           Our goal is to let the public know about our business. We want to show what Bountiful Foods has to offer, which is fresh, organic vegitables and fruits. We also want our audience to know that we are able to personalize their juice flavor. Our audience is for those that love to eat healthy and want to have a variety of choices to choose from. Also, we gear towards those that want fresh, organic fruits that everyone can enjoy. This is perfect for those that are on Health Shake diet.
